## A.F. Folino, G. Buja, P. Turrini, L. Oselladore, and A. Nava, “The
Effects of Sympathetic Stimulation Induced by Mental Stress on
Signal Averages Electrocardiogram,” Int’l J. Cardiology, vol. 48,
pp. 279-285, 1995.
## [[Heart Rate]] showed a significant main effect of emotion (vgl. [9,37,30])
### anger -> significant increase
### shame ->more  increase than control group
### self report reduced HR increase
## [[Pre-ejection Period]] also showed a significant main effect of emotion (vgl. [38])
### anger -> significant PEP decrease
### shame -> marginally greater decrease than control group
### self report reduced PEP increase
## [[Cardiac Output]] also showed a significant main effect of emotion (differing results in prior research [28,23,30])
### same reactions as before
### self report significantly reduced CO in anger group, not so much in shame & control group
## [[Total Peripheral Resistance]] Reactivity did not exhibit main effects for emotion
### instead self report had a significant reaction
## [[Blood Pressure]]
### Systolic [[Blood Pressure]] showed a significant main effect of emotions
## -> self report changes response to anger
## -> self report doesn't significantly change response to shame
