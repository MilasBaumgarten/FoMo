## A.F. Folino, G. Buja, P. Turrini, L. Oselladore, and A. Nava, “The
Effects of Sympathetic Stimulation Induced by Mental Stress on
Signal Averages Electrocardiogram,” Int’l J. Cardiology, vol. 48,
pp. 279-285, 1995.
## emotional responses: physiological systems, facial and vocal expressive tendencies and cognition ([3,4]) (vgl. [[Affect as a psychological primitive]], [[Emotion. In: Gilbert DT]])
### channels influence each other over time ([5])
## emotional events trigger secquences of neural activity ([6,7,8])
### -> changes in autonomic and neuroendocrine systems ([9,10])
## previous research showed distinct cardiovascular profiles ([31,32,30])
## [[Heart Rate]] showed a significant main effect of emotion (vgl. [9,37,30])
### anger -> significant increase
### shame ->more  increase than control group
### self report reduced HR increase
## [[Pre-ejection Period]] also showed a significant main effect of emotion (vgl. [38])
### anger -> significant PEP decrease
### shame -> marginally greater decrease than control group
### self report reduced PEP increase
## [[Cardiac Output]] also showed a significant main effect of emotion (differing results in prior research [28,23,30])
### same reactions as before
### self report significantly reduced CO in anger group, not so much in shame & control group
## [[Total Peripheral Resistance]] Reactivity did not exhibit main effects for emotion
### instead self report had a significant reaction
## [[Blood Pressure]] (vgl [39,40,41])
### Systolic [[Blood Pressure]] showed a significant main effect of emotions for anger (not for shame)
### Diastolic [[Blood Pressure]] showed a marginal main effect of emotion for anger (not for shame)
### not effected by self report
## -> self report changes response to anger
## -> self report doesn't significantly change response to shame
## [[Sensors]]
### [[Electrocardiogram]] [[Biopac ECG Module]]
#### 2 spot sensors in a lead II configuration (right arm, left leg)
#### 1000 Hz
### [[Impedence Cardiography]] [[HIC-2000]]
#### four adhesive mylar bands (neck, torso)
#### 1000 Hz
### [[Blood Pressure]] [[Colin Prodigy]]
#### measured intermittently at pre-defined intervals
##### frequent [[Blood Pressure]]  measurement might artificially elevate BP levels
#### -> some data loss
### Integration [[Biopac MP 150]]
